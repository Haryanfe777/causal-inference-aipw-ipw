# üß¨ Causal Inference Using IPW & AIPW with Machine Learning Models

This project conducts a comparative analysis of **Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW)** and **Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting (AIPW)** for causal inference using synthetic observational data. We explore estimator efficiency, robustness, and sensitivity using multiple machine learning models.

## üß† Project Overview

In real-world healthcare settings, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aren't always feasible. This project simulates such a scenario using a **synthetic dataset of 5,000 units** to evaluate two causal inference methods:

- **IPW** ‚Äî Basic propensity score weighting
- **AIPW** ‚Äî Doubly robust estimator combining propensity scores and outcome regression

We assess:
- Accuracy and consistency of causal effect estimates
- Performance across different outcome models
- Stability under robustness checks
- Covariate-level contributions to treatment effects

## üìà Causal Effect Results Summary

| Method               | ATE Estimate | Notes                                                        |
|----------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| IPW (DoWhy)          | 0.5316       | High sensitivity to extreme weights                         |
| AIPW (DoWhy)         | 0.4879       | More stable and efficient                                   |
| AIPW (Manual Impl.)  | ~0.49        | Matches DoWhy closely                                       |
| AIPW (CausalML)      | ~0.44        | Captures non-linearity well                                 |
| AIPW (EconML)        | ~0.47        | Consistent with DoWhy, assumes linear outcome model         |

‚úÖ AIPW consistently outperformed IPW by reducing variance and showing resilience to model misspecification.

## üß™ Robustness Checks ‚Äì Causal Validity

| Test                        | Outcome                                          | Interpretation                                        |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Placebo Test**           | AIPW drops from 0.4879 ‚Üí ~0.0105 (p = 0.8)       | Detects no effect under fake treatment ‚Äî as expected   |
| **Subset Refuter**         | AIPW drops slightly to 0.4264 (p = 0.3)          | Effect is stable even with smaller sample size         |
| **Random Confounder**      | No change in AIPW                                | Irrelevant variables don‚Äôt distort the estimate        |

‚úÖ These checks confirm that the causal estimates are **not artifacts of data quirks**, and **AIPW passes all sanity tests**.

## üß¨ Covariate-Level Causal Sensitivity Analysis

We tested how **individual covariates** influence the treatment effect using both IPW and AIPW. The AIPW method remained stable, while IPW showed significant inconsistency with multicollinearity.

| Covariate              | IPW ATE      | AIPW ATE     |
|------------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Age                    | ~0.32        | ~0.31        |
| Sex                    | ~0.26        | ~0.25        |
| Heart Rate             | ~0.28        | ~0.27        |
| Blood Pressure         | ~0.33        | ~0.30        |
| Comorbidity Index      | ~0.35        | ~0.34        |
| Lifestyle Factors      | ~0.37        | ~0.36        |
| **All Covariates**     | **-1.065**   | **0.841**    |

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **IPW failed** when using all covariates together ‚Äî large negative ATE suggests instability.
- ‚úÖ **AIPW stayed consistent** and gave a robust estimate with all variables included.

## üîç Effect of Outcome Model on AIPW

Different outcome models impact AIPW‚Äôs precision:

| Outcome Model       | AIPW ATE Estimate | Notes                                     |
|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Linear Regression    | 0.4837            | Overestimates slightly; assumes linearity |
| Random Forest        | 0.4416            | Most conservative; handles non-linearity  |
| Gradient Boosting    | 0.4701            | Balanced performance                      |

‚û°Ô∏è **Random Forest** delivered the most conservative (and likely accurate) estimates, while **Linear Regression** produced inflated results due to its simplicity.
