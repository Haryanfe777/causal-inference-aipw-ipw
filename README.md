# Causal Inference Using IPW &amp; AIPW with ML Models  This project compares Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) and Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting (AIPW) for estimating treatment effects in observational data. We use synthetic healthcare data and multiple ML models to demonstrate robustness and accuracy.
